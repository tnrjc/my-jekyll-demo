// Need the above so that Jekyll knows what to do with the markdown
// Below we seperate out our styles into different files that we can have control over

@import "var";  // we will create a variables style sheet to allow us to store site wide variabels
@import "main"; // we will create a site wide style sheet to contain larger global style items
@import "nav"; // This is the navigation style sheet








// THIS IS GOING TO GO LAST ALL THE TIME
@import "media-query"; // ALL MY MEDIA QUERY GOES HERE - ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US. - Grimes 2020



// We can continue this pattern, and create specific style sheets for specific areas of our site.
